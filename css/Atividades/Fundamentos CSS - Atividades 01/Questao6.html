        She's got a smile that it seems to me <br>
        Reminds me of childhood memories<br>
        Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky<br>
        Now and then when I see her face<br>
        She takes me away to that special place<br>
        And if I stare too long, I'd probably break down and cry<br>
    </p>
    <p class="refrao">
        Whoa, oh, oh Sweet child o' mine<br>
        Whoa, oh, oh, oh Sweet love of mine<br>
    </p>
    <p class="estrofe">
        She's got eyes of the bluest skies<br>
        As if they thought of rain<br>
        I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain<br>
        Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place<br>
        Where as a child T'd hide<br>
        And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by<br>
    </p>
    <p class="refrao">
        Whoa, oh, oh Sweet child o" mine<br>
        Whoa, oh, oh, oh Sweet love of mine<br>
